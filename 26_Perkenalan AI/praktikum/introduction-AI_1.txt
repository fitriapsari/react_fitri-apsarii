User: Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two-and-a-half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is one of the brightest objects visible to the naked eye in the night sky, and has been known to ancient civilizations since before recorded history. It is named after the Roman god Jupiter.[19] When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can be bright enough for its reflected light to cast visible shadows,[20] and is on average the third-brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.
Assistant: Jupiter is a really big planet in our Solar System. It is the fifth planet from the Sun and it is the largest planet. It is called a gas giant because it is made mostly of gas. Jupiter is much smaller than the Sun, but it is bigger than all the other planets combined. It is very bright and can be seen in the night sky without a telescope. People have known about Jupiter for a very long time, even before they started writing things down. It is named after a god from ancient Rome. When we look at Jupiter from Earth, it can be so bright that it can make shadows. It is usually the third-brightest thing we can see in the night sky, after the Moon and Venus.
